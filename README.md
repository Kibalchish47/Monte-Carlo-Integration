## Monte Carlo Integration using Python (Jupyter Notebook)
This mini-project aims to explain and perform Monte Carlo Integration on several non-trivial functions using Python (a Jupyter notebook). 

One could use this notebook as a tutorial for Monte Carlo approximation of non-trivial functions (I will try to make this as comprehensible as possible!!!). 

### Historical and mathematical context


### The Monte Carlo Method(s)
When a function cannot (or can be but in a very convoluted way) be integrated analytically, one should integrate it numerically. Monte Carlo integration consists of integrating a function using random numbers. 

In numerical integration, methods such as the trapezoidal rule use a deterministic approach. 

Monte Carlo integration, on the other hand, employs a non-deterministic approach: each realization provides a different outcome. In Monte Carlo, the final outcome is an approximation of the correct value with respective error bars, and the correct value is likely to be within those error bars.

### Issues
There are no actual issues as far as the mini-project goes, but here is a list of things to improve: 
- Better documentation for the mini-project (in the format of a guided tutorial)
- Better, more optimized, and more readable code
- A larger variety of functions go better illustrate the principles of Monte Carlo Integration

### Conclusion
