## Monte Carlo Integration using Python (Jupyter Notebook)
This mini-project aims to explain and perform Monte Carlo Integration on several non-trivial functions using Python (a Jupyter notebook). 

One could use this notebook as a tutorial for Monte Carlo approximation of non-trivial functions (I will try to make this as comprehensible as possible!!!).
